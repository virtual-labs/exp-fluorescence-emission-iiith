#### Pre-Experiment

- How is exciplex different from a permanent complex molecule?

- How is exciplex different from the complex formed in static quenching?

- If de-excitation of an exciplex lead to formation of ion pairs and free solvated ions, what kind of solvent media will favor such processes?

- Are formations of excimers and exciplexes diffusion-controlled or activation-controlled?

- What is effect of the solvent polarity on the exciplex emission wavelength?

#### Post-Experiment

- Why do the excimer and exciplex emission bands red-shift with respect to the monomer fluorophores?

- Why are excimer and exciplex emission bands broad and structure-less?

- Why are the emission bands of both anthracene and exciplex present together?

- Why does the intensity of monomer emission band decrease with the increase in monomer or complexing agent concentration?
