#### Pre-Assignment

1. How is exciplex different from a permanent complex molecule?  
2. How is exciplex different from the complex formed in static quenching?  
3. If de-excitation of an exciplex lead to formation of ion pairs and free solvated ions, what kind of solvent media will favor such processes?  
4. Are formations of excimers and exciplexes diffusion-controlled or activation-controlled?  
5. What is effect of the solvent polarity on the exciplex emission wavelength?

#### Post-Assignment

1. Why do the excimer and exciplex emission bands red-shift with respect to the monomer fluorophores?  
2. Why are excimer and exciplex emission bands broad and structure-less?  
3. Why are the emission bands of both anthracene and exciplex present together?  
4. Why does the intensity of monomer emission band decrease with the increase in monomer or complexing agent concentration?
